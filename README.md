# Xbox Rich Presence

*Note: Discord already haves an integrated presence for Xbox Live, but if you want to show more information about what you are playing on Xbox Live u can use this*
## This Rich Presence contains:
1. Game/app name
2. Game/app image (not all games/apps haves an image)
3. Timestamp
4. Device name (Xbox One, Xbox 360, etc) and image
5. Xbox Live Rich Presence (if game/app supports it)

*Note: Android and iOS has been removed for now because the rich presence "mixes" with the actual rich presence, please avoid playing on multiple devices while i try to make a device selector or something like that*
