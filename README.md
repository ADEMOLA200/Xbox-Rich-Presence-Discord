# Xbox Rich Presence (Deprecated, working on a remake)

Database got deleted, so if you don't see any image on your status that's why, I'm currently making a remake so stay tuned 

*Note: Discord already haves an integrated presence for Xbox Live, but if you want to show more information about what you are playing on Xbox Live u can use this*
## This Rich Presence contains:
1. Game/app name
2. Game/app image (not all games/apps haves an image)
3. Timestamp
4. Device name (Xbox One, Xbox 360, Android, etc) and image
5. Xbox Live Rich Presence (if game/app supports it)

## Example
